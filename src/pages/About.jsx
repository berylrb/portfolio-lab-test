      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <img src={Headshot} alt='headshot' />
      <p>I'm Beryl, a fullstack software engineer and startup founder who loves creating animations, illustrations, and interactive digital products that help solve real world problems-- no matter how small.
      <br />
      I strive to achieve a delicate balance between the technical and visual elements of every project I pursue (and can never decide which I love more).
      <br />
      I hold a BA in Psychology and Certificate of Innovation & Entrepreneurship from Duke University, as well as a Software Engineering Immersive Certificate from General Assembly.</p>
